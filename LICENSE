## Additional Terms for Production Use

### Security Disclaimer

This software includes cryptographic implementations and security-sensitive
features including WebAuthn/Passkey authentication and BLS signature schemes.
While the code has been carefully designed and tested, users are strongly
advised to:

1. Conduct independent security audits before production deployment
2. Deploy their own smart contracts and manage their own private keys
3. Never rely on the reference contract addresses for production applications
4. Implement additional security measures appropriate for their use case

### Smart Contract Disclaimer

The smart contracts included in this repository are provided as reference
implementations. Users must:

1. Deploy their own instances of all contracts
2. Conduct thorough testing on testnets before mainnet deployment
3. Perform security audits of all contract code
4. Understand the risks associated with blockchain deployments

### WebAuthn/Passkey Implementation Notice

The WebAuthn implementation follows FIDO2 specifications but users should:

1. Verify compatibility with their target platforms and devices
2. Implement appropriate fallback authentication methods
3. Test thoroughly across different browsers and operating systems
4. Consider privacy implications of biometric data handling
